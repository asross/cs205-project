To summarize, in this project we have:

- <%= check %> Devised a novel sampling method for intractable multimodal distributions, which arise in problems like sensor localization and topic modeling.
- <%= check %> Investigated the parallel scaling properties inherent to both the algorithm and the problem, with particular focus on the sampling efficiency vs. parallel scaling tradeoffs.
- <%= check %> Implemented both naive and hybrid parallel versions of our algorithm using MPI, OpenMP, OpenAcc, and multi-process parallelelism, demonstrating strong scaling along the way.
