One real-world application to which we can directly apply our method is sensor
localization, which is discussed by both <%= cite 'wormhole' %> and
<%= cite 'darting' %>.

The setup for this problem is as follows. Assume we have a collection of \\(N\\) sensors
with 2D or 3D locations \\(\vec{x}_k\\) which noisily attempt to communicate with each
other. For any pair of sensors \\(i\\) and \\(j\\), there is an exponentially decreasing
probability they can communicate at all, indicated by

$$
Z_{ij} \sim \text{Bern}\left(\exp\left(\frac{-||\vec{x}_i - \vec{x}_j||^2}{2R^2}\right)\right)
$$

Assuming \\(Z_{ij} = 1\\), i.e. that they _do_ manage to communicate, they transmit a noisy
measurement of their distance

$$
Y_{ij}|(Z_{ij} = 1) \sim \mathcal{N}\left(||\vec{x}_i - \vec{x}_j||, \sigma^2\right)
$$

where \\(R\\) and \\(\sigma\\) are known sensor parameters. The total
probability of observing our data \\(Y\\) and \\(Z\\) given our locations
\\(\vec{x}\\) is just the product of all of these terms for each \\(i, j\\)
pair.

In general we are interested in the reverse problem; we have the measurement
data but do not know the sensor locations. However, assuming a uniform prior on
the sensor locations, the probability of the locations given the data is
proportional to the probability of the data given the locations. For both MCMC
and rejection sampling, this is enough; we do not need to know the normalizing
constant of our distribution, just its relative density at each location.

In general (as you might imagine), the resulting posterior distributions of sensor
locations given measurement data are often multimodal, sometimes with many different
modes for each sensor. In the case below, which is for \\(N=8\\) on a 2D grid (with
three extra sensors with known locations, to resolve mirror symmetry ambiguities),
we have a 16-dimensional posterior distribution of the \\(x,y\\) locations of each
sensor, whose marginals are projected onto a 2D plane (with true locations represented
as circles):

As you can see, there is true multimodality to this real-world problem, with
multiple valid hypotheses for the locations of many sensors, which, as <%= cite 'wormhole' %>
shows, many state of the art MCMC methods fail to adequately
capture. Given additional time, it would be straightforward to apply our method
to this problem, and we believe it could be competitive with the algorithms
presented in <%= cite 'wormhole' %> and <%= cite 'darting' %>, especially if
\\(\epsilon\\) is tuned to optimize parallel resources.
